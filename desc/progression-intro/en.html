    The table on the right shows how many years of work experience are required to reach the various tiers and how long one must remain in each tier to be eligible for the next tier. The number in parentheses next to the years of experience indicates the additional years required to advance to the next tier.
    It is helpful for individuals seeking career advancement to know the qualifications for the various tiers. The table includes tiers from {{ (tvl_progr[(tvl_progr.keys()|list)[0]].keys()|list)[0] }}  to {{ (tvl_progr[(tvl_progr.keys()|list)[0]].keys()|list)[-1] }}  with corresponding pay grades {{ (tvl_progr.keys()|list)[-1] }} through {{ (tvl_progr.keys()|list)[0] }}.
