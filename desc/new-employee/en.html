    When a new employee is hired, they will be placed in the first tier of that salary scale if they have no relevant work experience. If the employee has at least one year of relevant work experience with the same employer, they will be placed in a higher tier, taking into account the length of their previous employment. If the employee has at least one year of relevant work experience with a different employer, they will be hired at the respective tier, depending on the length of their experience.

    Additionally, if the new hire has previously worked in a public sector job under the same salary regulations, the employer may take into account the tier they had achieved in their previous job when determining their tier in the new organization <a href="{{ jj_cfg.tvl_data["Meta.csv"]['link']['value'] }}"
