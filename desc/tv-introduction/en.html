    The Public Service Collective Agreement (TVöD) and the Collective Agreement for the Public Service of the Federal States (Länder) (TV-L) are collective agreements that apply to many public employers, including the federal government, the federal states, the municipalities and the social insurance carriers.

<p>
    These agreements are negotiated between representatives of the federal government, the United Services Union (ver.di), the Tarifgemeinschaft deutscher Länder (TdL), the Employers' Association of the Federal States (except Hesse), the Federation of Municipal Employers' Associations (VKA) and the unions responsible for the public sector.

    Together, the TV-L and the TVöD cover a wide range of occupations in the fields of administration, social and educational services, health care, justice, research, IT and more.
