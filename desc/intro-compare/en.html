<p>Welcome to the Public Sector Salary Comparison Tool. This page allows you to compare two different salary configurations side-by-side. You can select different tariffs (Tarifvertrag), pay groups (Entgeltgruppe), and steps (Stufe) to see how they impact your gross and net income. This is especially useful if you are considering a job switch, a promotion, or moving to a different region or tariff structure within the German public sector. Adjust the allowances, working hours, and tax classes on both sides to get a comprehensive view of your potential earnings.</p>
