    Germany has a system of six tax classes that determine the rate at which income from employment is taxed at source. A simplified guide: Tax Class 1 is for single, widowed, divorced, or legally separated individuals. Tax Class 2 is for single parents, and Tax Class 3 is for married couples where one spouse has a significantly higher income than the other. Tax Class 4 is for married couples with similar wages, while Tax Class 5 is for married couples where one spouse is in Tax Class 3 at the request of both spouses. Tax Class 6 applies to employees who receive multiple wages from multiple employers.

    Married couples can choose between two combinations of tax classes. The first option is 3/5, where the higher-earning spouse in tax bracket 3 receives a doubled basic tax exemption, while the lower-earning spouse in tax bracket 5 receives no basic tax exemption. The second option is 4/4, where both spouses receive the basic tax exemption. Single parents in Tax Class 2 are entitled to an additional tax allowance.

    It is important to note that the tax classes only affect the amount of income tax withheld from the salary, and the actual amount owed or refunded will be determined through an annual income tax declaration.
